## 🔍 How to Find Ticker Symbols

This widget pulls data directly from **Yahoo Finance**, so you need to use the exact ticker symbol listed on their website.

1.  Go to **[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com)**.
2.  Search for the company, crypto, or index you want (e.g., "Bitcoin", "Apple").
3.  Copy the symbol shown in parentheses next to the name.

**Examples:**

- **US Stocks:** `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `MSFT`
- **Cryptocurrency:** `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`, `DOGE-USD`

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

You can right-click the widget and hit **"Configure..."** to tweak almost everything. Here is what you can change:

### 1\. General Settings

- **Display Mode:** Toggle between showing one big stock or a list of many.
- **Single Ticker:** If you are in Single Mode, type the symbol here (e.g., `AAPL`, `BTC-USD`, `GOOG`).
- **Ticker List:** If you are in Multi-Mode, enter a comma-separated list here (e.g., `TSLA, MSFT, GOOG`).
- **Data Range:** Choose the data range for stocks (`1D`, `5D`, `1M`, `6M`, `YTD`, `1Y`, `5Y`, `Max`).

### 2\. Updates & Interval

- **Refresh Interval:** How often the data updates (in Minutes). Default is 5 minutes.

### 3\. Active Hours (Battery Saver)

- **Only update during market hours:** Check this to prevent the widget from waking up your network when the stock market is closed.
- **Market Open/Close:** Set the start and end time (e.g., 09:15 to 15:30) matching your local stock exchange time.
